## Tasks and List

List can have decendents ( a hirarchy ). List are what I have been calling a "tag" or "project".

Any entry w/o a list is an entry and ends up in the INBOX. When an entry is added to a list it becomes a task. 

Since each list can have descendents, a list can be givin an inbox as child list.

How do lists and workspaces/views work?
